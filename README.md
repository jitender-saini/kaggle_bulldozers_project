# kaggle_bulldozers_project
The goal of this project is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuration. The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.  Fast Iron is creating a "blue book for bulldozers," for customers to value what their heavy equipment fleet is worth at auction.
